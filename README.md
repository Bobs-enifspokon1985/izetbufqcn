OMG, just finished The Phoenician Scheme and it was a wild ride, seriously! Like, who comes up with this stuff? I mean, plotting one twist after another just to mess with your head, whaaat!? 😆 I swear, I haven't been this confused and entertained at the same time in ages. It's like trying to figure out the logic behind a passenger switching seats three times in one flight, you know what I mean? 🤷‍♀️

Anyway, picking out the main traitor was like playing whack-a-mole, every time I thought I had it figured out, bam! another plot twist. The way they kept adding those layers of conspiracy... phew, I need a break and a coffee, or maybe a cozy blanket and a nap, not even joking. And that main guy, what was his name again? Marcos? He was vibing some serious “I know something you don’t know” energy. Couldn’t decide if I wanted to hug him or just shake him until he spilled all the secrets.

> And don’t even get me started on the soundtrack! Who knew a little cello could make chasing villains feel classy, right? Seriously considering downloading the movie just to listen to that again on a sleepy overnight flight. Like, how does music make chaos feel so... grand?

Oh, and you remember that crazy bit in the middle where she drops the hint about the ancient code or whatever? I almost had to pause and catch my breath, haha! Running around with papers flying everywhere, like a scene from a day in the life of aisle 13, LOL. Honestly, if you haven’t already, you NEED to watch the movie. Trust me on this one. 😉

My brain's still trying to comprehend half the stuff that went down, and I can't decide what blew my mind more — the storyline or the fact that I stayed awake all through it. 😂 I should prob get some shut-eye soon. But first, I’m diving back in and rewatching the best scenes. Maybe looking at it from a different angle will lend a clue or help with those “how-did-I-not-see-that-coming” moments.

bool feelingDizzy = true;  // I don’t even know why I put this here. 😅

By the way, tell me how the day unfolds for you! Let’s catch up during my layover in Zurich next week. We can swap theories about what was really going on in that movie and, like, everything else under the sun. Miss ya, girl! 😘
